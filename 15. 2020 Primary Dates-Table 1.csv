NOTES:,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
"1.  In Arizona, the U.S. Senate election is for an Unexpired Term.",,,,,,,,,,,
"2.  In Idaho, the Governor effectively changed the date of the May 19, 2020, primary election by setting June 2, 2020, as the receipt date for absentee ballots.  The election was conducted as all absentee, and no polls were opened on May 19, 2020.",,,,,,,,,,,
"3.  In Connecticut and Utah, conventions are held by the political parties prior to the primary.  In Virginia, political parties may choose to nominate by convention rather than by primary election.  In other states, such as Indiana, Kansas, Maryland, Michigan, Oregon, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, West Virginia and Wyoming, minor parties may hold conventions to nominate candidates.",,,,,,,,,,,
"4.  In Ohio, the date of the March 17, 2020, primary election was effectively changed to April 28, 2020, by House Bill 197, signed by the Governor on March 27, 2020.",,,,,,,,,,,
"5.  In Louisiana, a Congressional primary election is not held.  The election for candidates seeking Federal office is the General election scheduled for 11/3/2020, with a Runoff Election held on 12/5/2020, if necessary.",,,,,,,,,,,

The FEC has jurisdiction over federal campaign finance law and does not have authority over the administration of elections.  Questions concerning a state’s primary election procedure should be addressed to the state’s Election Director.,,,,,,,,,,,
